## 📂 Repo Structure

This repository is primarily for:
- Public bug tracking
- Feature ideas
- Developer discussions

> The main Echolog source code lives in a private monorepo for now. SDKs and tooling will be open-sourced progressively.

## 🛠 How We Work

- We use **labels** to track bug types, platforms, and priorities
- Maintainers may ask for additional info before triaging an issue
- Features are reviewed for alignment with Echolog’s core mission

---

## ✅ Pull Requests (Eventually)

SDKs and the backend will be gradually open-sourced. When this happens:
- PRs should be linked to an open issue
- Include tests and documentation if applicable
- Follow the style guide for that project (to be published)
